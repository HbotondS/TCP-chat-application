# TCP-chat-application
I used C++ Winsock2 library for the server and Java for the client.
## Server
Multiple client can connect to the servers, currently there is only one group, where the clients can chat between each other.
## Client
Can connect to the groupchat and communicate with the other clients. Currently the client's name is their socket id, but later thay can choose a name for themself.
